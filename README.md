This course introduces students to computational methods for analyzing data to develop historical interpretations. It goes through the entire data life-cycle: finding, creating, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, interpreting, and integrating these interpretations into historical research. The course uses free and open source programming languages and tools designed for data analysis, specifically the R programming language. This approach has a steeper learning curve than point-and-click tools that provide an alternative method for creating digital projects. However, it puts the user in control, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and follows the guidelines of [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/). No previous experience with programming or data analysis is necessary. Over the semester students will work through a series of examples using provided datasets, and then they will have the opportunity to apply the methods to their own research, culminating in the creation of a project website.
