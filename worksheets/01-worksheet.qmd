Non-exercise math

```{webr} 
2 + 3
```


Assignment

```{webr} 
#| exercise: assignment
x ______ 5
```

::: { .solution exercise="assignment" }
::: { .callout-tip title="Solution" collapse="false"}
The assignment operator
```r
x <- 5
```
:::
:::

Exercises have their own environment, so `x` has to be redefined.

```{webr} 
#| exercise: variable
x <- 5
x * 2
```


Vector

Make `x` a vector of numbers.

```{webr}
#| exercise: vect
x
```

::: { .hint exercise="vect" }
::: { .callout-note collapse="false" }
## Hint 1

Make sure to use the assignment operator (`<-`)

```r
x <- ______
```
:::
:::

::: { .hint exercise="vect"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
## Hint 2

Vectors are created using the `c()` function, which stands for combine.

```r
x <- c(______)
```
:::
:::

::: { .solution exercise="vect" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Fully worked solution:

Values within `c()` are separated by commas.

```r
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```

You can also put exercises in a tabset: Make `y` a vector of numbers.

:::: {.panel-tabset}

## Exercise

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_4
y
```

## Hint 1

::: { .hint exercise="ex_4"}
Vectors are created using the `c()`, which stands for combine.

```r
y ______ c(______)
```
:::

## Hint 2

::: { .hint exercise="ex_4"}
Vectors are created using the `c()` function, which stands for combine.

```r
y <- c(______)
```
:::

## Solution

::: { .solution exercise="ex_4" }

```r
y <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
```
