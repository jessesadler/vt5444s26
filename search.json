Many of the weekly assignments will not be turned in. These will serve as a basis for discussion in class or will involve completing and playing around with the interactive worksheets. There will also be a few weekly assignments that will ask you to practice coding that will be turned in. These will be graded for effort and not correctness. The details of how these assignments will be turned in will be decided in the future.\nThese weekly assignments are due by the time our meetings start on Mondays at 2pm. They are listed in the Content section on the week they are due."

    "text": "Commonplace book\nThis course will ask you to do tasks and develop skills that are likely quite different from your other courses. As a way to keep track of your thoughts, notes, struggles, and progress, you are expected to keep a commonplace book during the semester.1 The commonplace book developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as a humanist learning and reading technique in which one copied down interesting passages, organized them, and possibly commented on them for future use.2\nYour commonplace book can be thought of as a blend of notes, journal, and scrapbook. It is a collection of things you find interesting. Commonplacing is having a bit of a resurgence right now. Check out this blog post for ideas on starting one. There is, of course, an r/commonplacebook community on Reddit and plenty of resources on using stationery for commonplace books. You might take inspiration from the slogan of Field Notes:\n\n“I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.”\n\nYour commonplace book can be digital, analog, or a combination of the two. Decide what tasks fit your needs the best."

These can be short (2–3 paragraphs and maybe around one page). These self reflections should discuss:\n\nwhat you think is going well in the class\nwhat you are excited to learn more about or dive into more deeply\nwhere you feel you are struggling\nwhat you can do, what your fellow students can do, and what I can do to help you"

The website should reflect the work you have done during the course and your research interests. You can reuse content from other courses or your current projects. This project, like the course in general, is much more about the journey than the destination.\nGrading of the project will be based on effort and creativity, both in the use of digital methods and tools, as well as historical research and argumentation. It is ok to experiment and try things out.\nStudents will present their websites on the last meeting of the semester and write a short self reflection encompassing the course and the final project."

The intention is for this to be an exploration of open source tools that can help you with historical analysis and publication. The primary expectations are a willingness to try and a readiness to learn. More specific expectations include:\n\nAttendance and active participation in all seminars. If you need to miss a seminar, please let me know.\nComplete and be ready to discuss all reading by our weekly meeting.\nCome to seminar with a computer ready to work and to participate in the weekly workshops.\nDo your best to complete all assignments on time. Record any difficulties you have and bring them to class to discuss.\nComplete the final project of creating a Quarto website.\n\nFinally, it is expected that all students will be respectful of each other. Students will enter the course at different levels of comfort with the tools that we will use. The goal of the course is to help each other get more comfortable with open source technologies.\n\nCode of conduct\nWith this final expectation in mind, we will be following the general Code of Conduct guidelines of The Carpentries. The main tenants of this code of conduct are:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\nFocus on what is best for the community\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members"

We will be discussing generative AI and large language models (LLMs) more during the semester, but the the short answer is that you are unlikely to learn to code and think computationally if your focus is on the end result and not learning. Just as writing an essay is an essential part of the thinking process, the actual typing of code is important to developing a better understanding of how programming and data analysis works. We will also discuss and demonstrate techniques for reading error messages and getting help with code that will limit the need to use generative AI. Once these foundations are laid, you will be better positioned to decide how and when to use generative AI for coding. How exactly we deal with this issue during the semester will be dependent upon student interest."

You will work through the entire data life-cycle: finding, creating, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, interpreting, and integrating these interpretations into your historical work. This will be done using free and open source programming languages and tools designed for data analysis, specifically we will be using the R programming language. This approach has a steeper learning curve than point-and-click tools that provide an alternative method for creating digital projects. However, it puts you in control, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and follows the guidelines of minimal computing. No previous experience with programming or data analysis is necessary. We will work through a series of examples using provided datasets, and then you will have the opportunity to apply the methods you have learned to your own research, culminating in the creation of a project website.\n\nDigital Scholarship Collaboration hour\n\n Students are encouraged to come to the weekly collaboration hour held in the Athenaeum to work on assignments/projects and ask questions.\n Thursdays\n 12pm–1:00pm\n Athenaeum Collaboration room, Newman Library 126"

Courses by Cameron Blevins, Lincoln Mullen, Zoë LeBlanc, and Brandon Walsh have been helpful guides in developing a computing heavy DH course. Courses by Andrew Heiss, Kieran Healy, and Clause Wilke have been useful for improving the Quarto website and integrating quarto-live into the site. I would also like to thank the Department of History at Virginia Tech for allowing me to teach this course and my colleagues in the University Libraries for their support and helping collaborate on the course."

    "text": "This section contains interactive worksheets that we will work through during class to get a bit of practice working with R before turning to using R on your own computer within RStudio. These worksheets provide a sort of coding playground that you can always come back to if you want some practice. Note that more complex worksheets may take a moment for the everything to load.\nAn interactive code section looks like this. Make changes in the text box and use the blue Run button to run the code. Change the code and run it as many times as you want. The original text can be reset with the Start Over button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive code may not always be complete in which case you will be prompted to complete the code to get it to run correctly. These interactive code blocks may have hints and even solutions.\nFor example, fill in the blank so that the result of the sum is 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to delete the underscores before entering the correct number.\n1 + 2 + 3 + \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n\n\n\n\nWe will be able to practice quite complex skills with these interactive lessons, including data visualizations. Let’s see how this works using the penguins dataset that comes with newer versions of R. The dataset contains body measurements of three species of penguins collected by the Palmer Station in Antarctica. For more about the data, see the palmerpenguins package.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\nFor instance, we can visualize a comparison of the flipper length to the body weight of the three species of penguins. Try it out by running the code! Test out what happens if you change things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to run R code in your browser is relatively new and is made possible by the quarto-live extension.",
