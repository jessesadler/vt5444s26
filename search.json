You will work through the entire data life-cycle: finding, creating, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, interpreting, and integrating these interpretations into your historical work. This will be done using free and open source programming languages and tools designed for data analysis, specifically we will be using the R programming language. This approach has a steeper learning curve than point-and-click tools that provide an alternative method for creating digital projects. However, it puts you in control, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and follows the guidelines of minimal computing. No previous experience with programming or data analysis is necessary. We will work through a series of examples using provided datasets, and then you will have the opportunity to apply the methods you have learned to your own research, culminating in the creation of a project website.\n\nDigital Scholarship Collaboration hour\n\n Students are encouraged to come to the weekly collaboration hour held in the Athenaeum to work on assignments/projects and ask questions.\n Thursdays\n 12pm–1:00pm\n Athenaeum Collaboration room, Newman Library 126"

The intention is for this to be an exploration of open source tools that can help you with historical analysis and publication. The primary expectations are a willingness to try and a readiness to learn. More specific expectations include:\n\nAttendance and active participation in all seminars. If you need to miss a seminar, please let me know.\nComplete and be ready to discuss all reading by our weekly meeting.\nCome to seminar with a computer ready to work and to participate in the weekly workshops.\nDo your best to complete all assignments on time. Record any difficulties you have and bring them to class to discuss.\nComplete the final project of creating a Quarto website.\n\nFinally, it is expected that all students will be respectful of each other. Students will enter the course at different levels of comfort with the tools that we will use. The goal of the course is to help each other get more comfortable with open source technologies.\n\nCode of conduct\nWith this final expectation in mind, we will be following the general Code of Conduct guidelines of The Carpentries. The main tenants of this code of conduct are:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\nFocus on what is best for the community\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members"

    "text": "Generative Artificial Intelligence\nGenerative AI tools are getting better and better at writing code, so why do I recommend that you not use it to complete the work in this course? We will be discussing generative AI and large language models (LLMs) more during the semester, but the the short answer is that you are unlikely to learn to code and think computationally if your focus is on the end result and not learning. Just as writing an essay is an essential part of the thinking process, the actual typing of code is important to developing a better understanding of how programming and data analysis works. We will also discuss and demonstrate techniques for reading error messages and getting help with code that will limit the need to use generative AI. Once these foundations are laid, you will be better positioned to decide how and when to use generative AI for coding. How exactly we deal with this issue during the semester will be dependent upon student interest."
