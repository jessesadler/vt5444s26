On the one hand, Markdown leverages the advantages of plain text: it is light weight, highly portable, non-proprietary, and easily searchable across different documents. On the other, Markdown text can be turned into HTML, PDFs, and even Word documents with stylized text through different interpreters.\nThis document provides a basic overview of the Markdown syntax. Note that there are various “flavors” of Markdown that have different capabilities, but the basic syntax is largely shared.",

Typically, you will create layers using a geom_ function, overriding the default position and stat if needed.”\nYou also build plots in ggplot2 by adding layers, using + between the different components of the plot to iteratively develop a visualization.\n\nWe can translate the grammar of graphics into generalized ggplot2 code as follows:\n\nggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + \n  geom_*(\n     mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;),\n     stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, \n     position = &lt;POSITION&gt;\n  ) +\n  scale_*(&lt;SCALES&gt;, &lt;GUIDES&gt;) + \n  labs(&lt;LABELS&gt;) + \n  coord_*() + \n  facet_*() + \n  theme()\n\nNote that you do not need to specify all of these elements for your plots. ggplot2 will choose reasonable defaults for those elements you do not specify. Let’s now see what this looks like with an actual plot of the penguins data.\n\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_bar(\n    mapping = aes(x = island, fill = species),\n    stat = \"count\", # default stat for geom_bar(). Calculates y.\n    position = \"dodge\" # position bars next to each other\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) + # fill scale\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120, by = 20)) + # More guides for y axis\n  coord_cartesian() + # default coordinates\n  labs(title = \"The Palmer Archipelago penguins\",\n       x = \"Islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica\",\n       y = NULL, # Remove label for y axis\n       fill = \"Penguin species\") + \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13, # Change base theme and font\n                base_family = \"Times New Roman\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove minor grid lines\n        legend.position = \"top\", # change position of legend\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\") # and legend direction",

    "section": "RStudio projects",
    "text": "RStudio projects\nOne of the foundational features of RStudio is the concept of projects. Projects set up your analyses for reproducibility by making it clear where your analysis lives and how your data, scripts, and all other files that belong to an analysis are related to each other. In short, they are all contained in a project folder. Projects are based on R’s notion of the working directory. This is the folder where R starts when you ask it to load data files or save scripts. If this is the first time that you have opened RStudio, your working directory is probably your home directory. On macOS this is represented with ~/, on Windows likely with C:\\Users\\[your-username]. You can see this at the top of the console panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Current working directory.\n\n\n\nRStudio projects provide a clear and explicit way to tell R where to start (to set your working directory) and keep all of your analysis together. Let’s create our first project. This project will hold all of the code and data we will work on in our in-class sessions. When you want to work on a project with your own data, follow these steps again to create a new project in a different folder.\n\nGo to the File menu and select New Project…\nIn the New Project Wizard select New Directory.\nChoose New Project for the Project type.\nName your project and choose where to put it.\n\nFor this first project under Directory name we will use r-notes.\nThen, select Browse… to put the project folder inside your hist5444s26 folder that contains the work done for this course. If you have not created this folder yet, do so now in Finder or File Explorer.\nFinally, select Create Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Steps to create a project: (top) select New Directory, (middle) choose New Project for the project type, (bottom) choose what to name the project and where to put it.\n\n\n\nRStudio will start back up but now your working directory will be the new project folder you created, in this instance r-notes. You can verify you are in your new project in four different locations in the RStudio interface.\n\nThe name of the RStudio window will now contain r-notes.\nThe top of the has the path on your computer from your home to the project folder. For me it is ~/Documents/hist5444s26/r-notes.\nThe project dropdown on the top-right of the RStudio window. You can use this menu to quickly switch between different projects.\nThe files panel will show the path to your working directory and a single file named r-notes.Rproj.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: RStudio project interface, highlighting areas that show the current project.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up your project structure\nLet’s finish setting up the new project by providing some structure, adding folders to separate our raw data, any modified data we create, our scripts we write, and the figures we make. The most important aspect of this is to separate our raw data from our modified data we create using R.1 Keeping these two types of data separate will protect you from making errors and possible data loss. You can add the folders in the RStudio files panel by clicking ojn the folder with the plus sign, or you can create the folders in Finder or File Explorer. Your folders should be named:\n\ndata/: Any modified data that you want to store after cleaning or analyzing your raw data.\ndata-raw/: Raw data that you have created or gotten from an external source.\nscripts/: Where you will keep your R scripts and any other documents such as Quarto documents.\nfig/: A place to store any visualizations you make in the course of your analysis.\nREADME.md: Lastly you can create a README file to explain the purpose and structure of the project. To create a new Markdown file in RStudio go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; Markdown File.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Project folders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat is the r-notes.Rproj file?\n\n\n\nThe r-notes.Rproj file is a plain text file that has a couple of project based settings in it. You can click on it in RStudio and it will open a dialogue window. Generally, you do not want to touch the file. Primarily, the file projects the best target for opening up your project. Double-click on any .Rproj file and RStudio will open to that project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteRelative vs absolute paths\n\n\n\nProjects enable you to access files such as data with relative paths from your working directory. Within our r-notes project we can access a data file called SAFI_clean.csv using the relative path: data-raw/SAFI_clean.csv.\nIf we did not use projects and kept our working directory as our home directory, we would have to use absolute paths. Absolute paths point to a file or folder regardless of the working directory. On my computer it would be ~/Documents/hist5444s26/r-notes/data-raw/SAFI_clean.csv. This might work for those on a Mac because we were specific about naming our folders, but it will not work on Windows.\nIf you were to move the r-notes folder into another folder, absolute paths would not even work on your computer any more. However, if you give your r-notes folder to someone else and you use projects and relative paths, the paths will correctly find the data on their computer.",

    "section": "The workflow",
    "text": "The workflow\nThe basic workflow for RStudio is to work on writing and running code in the left two panels and inspect aspects of what you are doing or what you have created in the right two panels.2 Let’s concentrate on the two panels on the left.\nThe console can be thought of as where the action happens. It is where code is actually run and where any outputs will be printed. However, the console is also ephemeral. You run code expression by expression, pushing each line of code further and further up into the console’s history, out of sight and out of mind. You can look at your history, but, practically speaking, there is no good, clear way to track what you have done just by using the console.\nThis is where the editor panel comes in. The editor panel shows text documents in which you will save the code and any documentation or explanations that you want to save. We will primarily be working with R scripts and Quarto documents in this course. Here, we will stick to R scripts.\n\nScripts and reproducibility\nScripts are at the foundation of reproducibility. They contain the code that performed a certain set of analysis or created a visualization that can be run by you or someone else later. Unlike the console, scripts are meant to be permanent or at least record what you have done. You save scripts, but you do not save what happened in the console.3\nAn R script is a plain text document in which everything that is typed is assumed to be R code that will be sent to the console. To run code from a script (or send it to the console) you cannot just type Return/Enter. That moves you to the next line. Instead, place your cursor anywhere within an R expression and press Cmd + Return or Ctrl + Enter. If you want to write comments in a script to take notes or tell future you or any collaborators why you did something, you need to place a hashtag # before it. Anything after # will not be run as code.\n\nExecute an R expression from a script: place cursor within the expression and press Cmd + Return or Ctrl + Enter\nComment: #\n\nTry it out for yourself.\nThis distinction between permanent and ephemeral also translates to the panels on the right. The files pane (bottom right) shows the scripts you create and any data or visualization you save. These are permanent. The environment panel shows the objects created in a session by running code in the console. These objects are ephemeral. They exist and can be used in this session, but they can always be recreated from the script.\nThe script trumps the environment panel; it is the source of truth. The code that creates the object is much more important than the object itself. Think of it this way, if you have it right in the environment but wrong in a script, it will not do you much good when you come back to your code after a break and find that things are out of whack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The editor and files panels are the primary sources of truth. The console and environment panels represent the ephemeral objects created in a session.",

Go to Tools -&gt; Global Options and uncheck Restore .RData into workspace at startup and set Save workspace to .RData on exit to Never.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: RStudio Global Options: Set these options for the Workspace.\n\n\n\nLet’s see what this does. Make sure that you have created objects in your environment. Then, restart your session. You can do this by going to the Session menu -&gt; Restart R. Your environment panel should be empty now. This might seem like it is painful, but it is short-term pain for long-term gain. It will teach you to keep what you want to save in your R script so that you can always recreate objects or rerun analysis later.\nIn fact, running Restart R and then running your script, either one line at a time (hit Cmd + Return or Ctrl + Enter over and over) or Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to re-run the entire script, is a good way to ensure that your script is correct. Better to find out now if there is a problem than weeks or months down the road.",

    "section": "Packages",
    "text": "Packages\nAfter getting RStudio set up, the next step is to install the main packages we will use in the course. R comes with a preinstalled set of packages known as base R. The real power of R comes from combining this strong foundation for data analysis with other packages built by community members. Generally you will install packages through the central package repository called CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network), which is also where you downloaded R. There are over 23,000 packages on CRAN.4\n\nInstalling packages\nMost importantly for this class, we need to install the tidyverse set of packages. There are two ways to do this. Either through a function on the console or using the RStudio GUI (Graphical User Interface). I generally prefer to use the console.\n\nYou can install packages with the install.packages() function with the names of the packages you want to install in a character vector. Let’s start by just installing the tidyverse package.\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nTo use the graphical interface to install packages:\n\nSelect the Packages tab in the Files panel on the bottom right of RStudio.\nClick on Install button on the top left of the panel.\nThis will open a popup dialogue. Type in the packages you want to install—in this case tidyverse—and then click Install.\nNote that RStudio will actually run the command install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Installing packages with the Packages panel in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing packages\nThe tidyverse set of packages is now installed, but to actually use the functions from the package in an R session you need to load the package. This is done with library(). Try it for yourself.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nYou do not need to put quotation marks around tidyverse because the library() function knows where to look for something called tidyverse. You can put quotation marks around it if you want to. You should get an output in your console that looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Output from loading the tidyverse, showing the packages loaded and functions that conflict with those from other packages.\n\n\n\nYou see a list of the nine core tidyverse packages and their versions: dplyr, forcats, ggplot2, lubridate, purrr, readr, stringr, tibble, tidyr. You will also see a message that there are conflicts. This sounds scary but is expected behavior. This message tells us that dplyr has functions called filter() and lag(), which are also names for functions in base R. When you use these function after loading the tidyverse, you will use the dplyr version, which is what we want.\nRemember, because we set up RStudio for reproducibility, you need to run library(tidyverse) every time you begin a new session. Therefore, you should load the packages you will use at the start of your script. Writing library(tidyverse) at the top of each script is a good practice to begin with.\n\n\nUpdating packages\nPackages are often changing, fixing bugs (and adding some) and bringing new features so it is a good idea to update your packages every once in a while.5 Again, there is a way to do this in the console and through the Packages panel.\n\nRun update.packages() and choose y to update the packages.\nTo use the graphical interface to update packages:\n\nClick on Update button on the top left of the Packages tab of the Files panel. It is right next to Install.\nYou can click the Select All button on the bottom right of the dialogue window that pops up.\nThen Install Updates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Updating packages with the Packages panel in RStudio.",

The settings for RStudio are found under Tools -&gt; Global Options. Under the Appearance tab you can change the color theme for RStudio, choose your font and font size.\nAnother change that I like to make is in the R Markdown tab. This changes the settings for notebook-like files such as R Markdown and Quarto. I like to uncheck Show output inline for all R Markdown documents. This makes Quarto documents act more like scripts. Instead of printing output below a cell block and in the console, the output only goes to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Change the color scheme, font, and font size of RStudio in the Appearance settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: You may want to uncheck Show output inline for all R Markdown documents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Code tab has a couple of settings that you might want to change.\n\nI suggest using the native pipe operator (|&gt;) by checking the box.\nUnder Display you might want to uncheck Show margin. This will turn off the vertical line in the editor pane.\nAt the bottom of Display there is a check box for rainbow parentheses. This turns each set of parentheses a different color, which can help you keep track of where you are in more complex code.\n\nPlay around with the themes to make RStudio a nice, fun place to be.

You do not need to know what the command line, R, or git is. That is what the course is for. The intention is for this to be an exploration of open source tools that can help you with historical analysis and publication. The primary expectations are a willingness to try and a readiness to learn. More specific expectations include:\n\nAttendance and active participation in all seminars. If you need to miss a seminar, please let me know.\nComplete and be ready to discuss all reading by our weekly meeting.\nCome to seminar with a computer ready to work and to participate in the weekly workshops.\nDo your best to complete all assignments on time. Record any difficulties you have and bring them to class to discuss.\nComplete the final project of creating a Quarto website.\n\nFinally, it is expected that all students will be respectful of each other. Students will enter the course at different levels of comfort with the tools that we will use. The goal of the course is to help each other get more comfortable with open source technologies.\n\nCode of conduct\nWith this final expectation in mind, we will be following the general Code of Conduct guidelines of The Carpentries. The main tenants of this code of conduct are:\n\nUse welcoming and inclusive language\nBe respectful of different viewpoints and experiences\nGracefully accept constructive criticism\nFocus on what is best for the community\nShow courtesy and respect towards other community members"

We will be discussing generative AI and large language models (LLMs) more during the semester, but the the short answer is that you are unlikely to learn to code and think computationally if your focus is on the end result and not learning. Just as writing an essay is an essential part of the thinking process, the actual typing of code is important to developing a better understanding of how programming and data analysis works. We will also discuss and demonstrate techniques for reading error messages and getting help with code that will limit the need to use generative AI. Once these foundations are laid, you will be better positioned to decide how and when to use generative AI for coding. How exactly we deal with this issue during the semester will be dependent upon student interest."

    "text": "1 A note on packages\nIn Getting started with R we encountered our first functions. Functions come from packages. There are a base set of packages that come with R and a subset of these are loaded every time you start R. These packages and the functions they contain are known as base R; they are what we have been using. The real power of R comes from combining this strong foundation for data analysis with other packages built by community members. This is great, but it also adds complexity. There is (essentially) always multiple ways to accomplish the same task.\nWe will be using many of these extra packages during the course. Most extensively, we will be using the tidyverse set of packages. The tidyverse provides an alternative way to work with data from base R, though the two are always used together. It is not an either or situation. Whereas a data frame in base R is called a data.frame, in the tidyverse it is a tibble.1 These two data types are interchangeable, but there are slight differences. The most notable difference is the way the data frames are printed to the console.\n\nTo use a package you need to load it\nEverytime you want to use a package that is not in base R in a session, you need to load it. Think of it this way. You download a package once; you load it in each session. Let’s do that now with two packages from the tidyverse set of packages: tibble to create data frames, readr to read in data, and dplyr to look at parts of a data frame.2 You load a package with the library() function.",

Let’s do one that has columns for names, age, and historical period of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the structure of how you create a data frame (and the coding style). The structure consists of a series of vectors, separated by commas, that are set to names (with the equal sign), which become the names set to columns.\nNote too how a tibble is printed:\n\nWe see the dimensions of the data frame. In this case four rows and three columns (4x3).\nBelow each column name, the data type of the column appears between angled brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteNumeric vectors\n\n\n\nThe age column is represented as dbl, which stands for double-point precision numbers or doubles. Without getting into the mathematical foundations of doubles or floating point numbers, they are numbers that can have decimals. The other primary numeric type in R is integer. R will default to using doubles because they are more permissive.\n\n\nMake your own data frame that mimics a type of data you would like to use this semester. Just make a couple of columns and rows.",

    "text": "4 Reading in data\nThe most common way you will access a data in the form of a data frame is by reading it in to your R session.\nLet’s read in data using a url to a dataset on GitHUb with the read_csv() function. We use read_csv() because the data is in a csv or comma separated values file. This will read the data in as a tibble and we will assign it to the name interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at the output we get in reading this data into our session. When something is printed to the console, it is always good practice to read what it says. Sometimes it shows the data, sometimes an error that needs to be fixed, sometimes a warning that we might want to look into, or, as in this case, a message that provides information.\nFirstly, we learn that read_csv() used the url() function to get the data. That is nice but does not really affect us. Next, read_csv() provides information about the data we loaded. and how it parsed the different columns. The data frame has 131 rows and 14 columns. There are 7 character columns, 6 numeric columns , and one dttm vector, which is short for date time. We also see a message about how we can get more details or quite the message.\nLet’s print interviews to the console to see what it looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that read_csv() reads in data as a tibble. You can use the similarly named read.csv() (note the _ vs the .) to read in the data as a data.frame. This might also be the first time you see how tibbles treat columns that do not fit within the console.",

For now, let’s concentrate on some functions that help us look at the data frame we have read in to our session.\nA really useful function when dealing with any data object in R is str() which stands for structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a tibble such as interviews we get two sets of overlapping information. We first get the data frame turned on its side (columns now appear as rows), which highlights the column names and variable types. Secondly, it shows how the columns were parsed by read_csv().\nYou can get a similar view of the data frame turned on its side with the glimpse() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is great, but you might not need all this information. Say you have forgotten the names of the columns in your data frame. It happens all the time. You can use the names() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to get a sense of the data contained in a data frame is to get some basic summary statistics on each of the columns with the summary() function. Currently, this is not all that useful for character columns, but you do get an overview of numeric columns.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might also want to look at different rows of the data frame. head() and tail() by default show, respectively, the first and last six rows.

However, the plot we are looking to replicate shows information about the species of penguin, which is not available in our current plot. We can do this by mapping the species variable in our data to another aesthetic. In this case, color, but since people can perceive color in different ways, it is always a good idea to add another way to distinguish the differences within a variable such as by shape. Since we are mapping the data to aesthetics, we need to use the aes() function again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy mapping an aesthetic beyond x and y, ggplot2 automatically creates a legend for us: red circles are Adelie, green triangles are Chinstrap, and blue squares are Gentoo.

Both of these issues make it difficult to perceive the dispersal of points. We can adjust these aesthetic features not by mapping them to the penguins data but by setting them. You can set an aesthetic feature by equating it to a constant value outside the aes() function. We can set size to 3, and the transparency, or alpha, to 0.8. We can also tell geom_point() to remove missing data with na.rm = TRUE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay around with these values. What happens if you change size and alpha? What if you set color to a specific color such as \"blue\" within the aes() function?3 Try setting color to blue outside the aes() function. Look at the documentation for geom_point() to see other possible aesthetics.\nSetting color = \"blue\" within the aes() function will quickly show you the significance of understanding the difference between mapping and setting. You map aesthetics to columns in the data within aes(); you set aesthetics to constants outside the aes() function.\nA final distinction that is worth a quick mention here.

By default, ggplot applies scale_color_discrete() for the colors, but you can adjust this using functions that begin with scale_color_. Try with scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Pastel1).

You will get errors, but that is ok. Instead of moving on to the next code expression, you repeat the process with the code block you are on, checking error messages, changing what you think might be the problem, and trying again. You do this over and over to create a full script that accomplishes a set task.\nIn this web-based R session you can alter the code, fill in blanks, or write your own expressions, and then run it by selecting the blue Run Code button. The output, if any, will appear below the code section.\nUse hints where they exist and solutions if you need them. You can copy the code in the solution by mousing over the far right side of the solution code.",

    "section": "2 Creating objects",
    "text": "2 Creating objects\nPrinting out values is nice, but you will probably want to save values to use elsewhere in your script. You save values, by assigning it to a name or variable. This creates an object that is stored in your coding environment. You assign a name to an object with the assignment operator (&lt;-). Run the code below. What difference do you notice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWhat was different?\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing is printed when you run the code.\n\n\n\nYou can think of this code as saying x gets the value of 5. When a value is assigned, it does not print out to the console. To print out the value of an object, write the name of the object on its own line and run the code block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to use the assignment operator (&lt;-)\nx &lt;- 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to type Return or Enter after the first line of code to get to the second line of the interactive code block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nTo print out the value of x to the console, write it on its own line and run the code block.\nx &lt;- 5\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipObject vs variable\n\n\n\nIn R everything is an object. Technically x is now a named object. However, it is common to also refer to it as a variable. These two terms will largely be used synonymously in this course, especially in spoken language.\n\n\nOnce you have created an object, you can use it to create other values. In the next code block, use x to calculate a new value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use x as you would the number 5. For instance:\nx * 24\n\n\n\n\nNext, use the expression you wrote above to create a new named object using the assignment operator. Use whatever name you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn naming\nWhen choosing a name for an object in R, you should be aware of the rules but also issues of style.\n\nNaming rules\n\nObject names must start with a letter.\nNames can only contain letters, numbers, _, and ..\nCannot use names that are predefined in R such as TRUE or FALSE.\n\n\n\nNaming style\nThere are different style conventions for naming objects. It is best to pick one style and be consistent.\n\nthis_is_snake_case &lt;- value\norCamelCase &lt;- value\nyou.can.use.periods &lt;- value\nBELOUD &lt;- value\nor.JUst_inconsistent &lt;- value\n\nIn this course, we will use snake case, which is probably the most widely used style. You can use whatever style you like, but snake case means you do not have to guess whether you used capital letters or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBe aware: R is case sensitive\n\n\n\nThis means that my_obj is different from My_obj. Computers are persnickety. You must be precise in your instructions. Computers do what you type, not what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipChoosing good names\n\n\n\nIt is best practice to name objects descriptive names even if they are longer. Names like x and y or data tell you nothing about what they are. Use descriptive names that match the data assigned to the object name.2\n\n\nNow we have two named objects. What happens when you assign a new number to x? What happens to the other object you created using x? Does it also change? Check by printing the values out to the console. What do the answers to these questions tell you about the nature of objects in R?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of x is now 15. But any object created using the original value of x remains unchanged.\nx &lt;- 15\nx\nyour_object",

    "section": "3 Do things with functions",
    "text": "3 Do things with functions\nFunctions take input, perform specific actions, and then return values. You can identify a function in R by the opening and closing parentheses that follow a name. Within the parentheses are a set of arguments that are set to values. These arguments are separated by commas.\n\nfunction_name(argument1 = value1, argument2 = value2, ....)\n\nLet’s use our first function! 🎉\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\nThat is nice! But rather limited. What else can we do with the round() function? Let’s read the documentation for the function by placing a question mark immediately in front of the function name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that this is actually the documentation of a set or family of functions. There are a couple of sections of the help page that are, well, particularly helpful.\n\nDescription: a short description of what the function is designed to do.\nUsage: tells you the available arguments and their default values if any. Note that digits is set to 0 for round() but 6 for signif().\nArguments: provides an explanation of each argument and the type of data it can be.\nExamples: R code that you can run to see how a function works. Some examples are really helpful; some are less so.\n\nLets use the digits argument. Round 42.358964 to 3 decimal places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nround(x = 42.358964, digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nWhat do the other functions in the Rounding of Numbers family do? What happens if you set digits to a negative number? How about if you set digits to something that is not a number? Try it out:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction coding style\nThere are two ways to define arguments within a function: by name or by position. The usage section of a function’s help page shows the argument names and the order in which they are expected to occur.\n\nYou do not need to write the argument names if you put them in the correct order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need to place arguments in the correct order if you name them. However, it will drive you batty if you do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not name arguments and place them in the wrong order, you will get errors or, even worse, incorrect results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost often the two styles will be combined. This is particularly true for dropping the name of the first argument, which generally takes the data you are inputting into the function while naming the other arguments that affect how the function is performed. In this case, writing x = 42.358964 does not particularly help our understanding of the function, but digits = 3 does help us remember that we are telling round() to round to the 3rd digit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAssignment: &lt;- vs =\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create named objects with the equal sign (=) in place of the assignment operator (&lt;-). You may see some code that does this. However, the vast majority of R code uses the assignment operator. One benefit of this is that it helps to distinguish assignment of objects (&lt;-) from the assignment of arguments within functions (=).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother note on style\nIn the R code shown so far there has been spaces between the different elements in a code block. This is not necessary. R is generally agnostic to white space. The two below examples are the same as far as R is concerned, but I know which one I want to read more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be more typing to use spaces, but you also need to read and understand your own code. Test out spacing in your R code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpacing generally does not matter but try to be consistent and keep things that are supposed to be together, especially the assignment operator: this (&lt;-) not this (&lt; -). You will also want to avoid putting a space between the function name and the parentheses: round (42.358964, 3).",

This is fine, but what if we want to make the same calculation on a set of values or find out information about a set of values. We can do this with vectors, an ordered set of values that are of the same data type. R was built to work with vectors. In fact, we have already been working with vectors, vectors of length 1.\nYou can create your own vectors with the c(...) function, which stands for combine. c() takes any number of values—of the same type—separated by a comma.3\nLet’s start by making a vector named households that contains 5 numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to use the assignment operator (&lt;-)\nhouseholds &lt;- ______\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors are created using the c() function, which stands for combine.\nhouseholds &lt;- c(______)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA possible solution:\n\n\n\n\n\nValues within c() are separated by commas.\nhouseholds  &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 5, 2)\n\n\n\n\nWe can then use different functions or perform different actions on households just as we did with x above.

What happens if you create a really long vector?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make more complex vectors of numbers, take a look at the documentation for seq() and try it out.

So what happens if you mix them? Try it out by creating a new vector that combines households and historians. You do not need to assign it a name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use c() on vectors.\nc(households, historians)\nTry adding more instances of historians or households within c().\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are now quotation marks around the numbers. They are now characters. R combines different vector types by coercing the more specific type—in this case the numeric class—to the less specific type—in this case to character class.\n\n\nLogical vectors\nThe last main vector type that type that should be mentioned in this intro to working with R worksheet is logical made up of TRUE and FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the primary ways to create a logical vector is by using conditionals.

It is a collection of things you find interesting. Commonplacing is having a bit of a resurgence right now. Check out this blog post for ideas on starting one. There is, of course, an r/commonplacebook community on Reddit and plenty of resources on using stationery for commonplace books. You might take inspiration from the slogan of Field Notes:\n\n“I’m not writing it down to remember it later, I’m writing it down to remember it now.”\n\nYour commonplace book can be digital, analog, or a combination of the two.

You do not have to pick just one. You can use one text editor for a certain task and another text editor for a different one. They are all based on your plain text files that are in your file system on your computer.\nThey can work with all different kinds of plain text documents, not only files that you might think of as presenting content (Markdown, HTML, csv, txt, etc.) but also scripts for programming languages (R, Python, Bash, etc.).\nThere are multiple free and open source options for text editors.\nText editors like Visual Studio Code and Zed are full integrated development environments (IDEs) that have all sorts of tools for writing code, including documentation, code completion, and their own command line interface.\n\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThis last point gets to one of the main drawbacks of text editors. They can be overly complex and confusing; they can be too much when you just want to quickly jot something down.\nThis is also true for Obsidian, which has an almost endless amount of options for how you can use it.\nYou also need to invest at least some time in learning how to use your chosen editor if you want to get many of the benefits of its power.\nIt is up to you how deep you want to go on this. The goal is to write better research not to create the perfect system.",

    "section": "Usage",
    "text": "Usage\nThe power of text editors is their ability to work on one file at a time or across multiple files and folders. You can open a single file, but most of the power of text editors is unleashed by opening a folder of files and working on multiple files at once.\nText editors also work best by taking advantage of keyboard shortcuts. Each editor will have different features and shortcuts. However, Zed can be set up to use the same shortcuts as Visual Studio Code by default. You can also learn keyboard shortcuts one at a time by using the command palette, a dialogue that allows you to search for commands. The command palette shortcut is:\n\nVisual Studio Code, VSCodium, and Zed: Cmd + Shift + P or Ctrl + Shift + P\nBBEdit: Cmd + Shift + U\nObsidian: Cmd + P or Ctrl + P.\n\nAll of these text editors have a shortcut or button to live preview Markdown documents, to see the headings (#) turned into larger headings, links[]() hyperlinked text, and bold (**) and italic (*) into bold and italic text.\n\nVisual Studio Code, VSCodium, and Zed: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + V\n\nPressing Cmd/Ctrl + K and then V will open the preview to the right.\n\nBBEdit: Control + Cmd + P\nObsidian: Cmd/Ctrl + E to toggle between editing and preview modes.\n\nThis is the merest tip of the iceberg of the powers of these text editors. They can do all sorts of things for you, including searching across thousands of files, linking files to each other, and enabling the use of multiple cursors to make changes in many places at once. One way to see what you can do is to search through the keyboard shortcuts available in a text editor.\n\nVisual Studio Code, VSCodium, and Zed: Cmd/Ctrl K + Cmd/Ctrl S\nBBEdit: Look through the command palette with Cmd + Shift + U\nObsidian: Look through the command palette with Cmd/Ctrl + P",

Even if you work with a specific data frame for a long time or have used a function hundreds of times, you may need to remind yourself of a column or argument name. You can do both of these activities in RStudio through the GUI or by running code. If you do it by running code, this is a good example of the different uses of the console compared to a script. Because you are looking for information right now rather than noting that you will always want this information, you should be running this code in the console.\nRStudio has a powerful Data viewer in which you can view data frames in a spreadsheet-like manner. You can view a data frame in the viewer by either:\n\nClick on the data frame in the Environment pane.\nRun View(data_name) in the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Quickly view data frames in a spreadsheet-like environment by running View(data_name) or clicking on a data frame object in the environment pane on the right.\n\n\n\nYou can read the documentation for a function in the Help tab. RStudio even provides a link to run the examples found at the bottom of the help page. To get to the documentation for a function you can either:\n\nGo to the Help tab in the File pane on the bottom right and search for the function.\nRun ?function_name in the console.",

Because Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Return not only runs the current expression, it also moves the cursor to the next expression, you can hold down Ctrl or Cmd` and hit return quite quickly.
