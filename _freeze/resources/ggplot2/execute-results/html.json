As described in the [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#layers), \"A layer combines data, aesthetic mapping, a geom (geometric object), a stat (statistical transformation), and a position adjustment. Typically, you will create layers using a `geom_` function, overriding the default position and stat if needed.\"\n2. You also build plots in ggplot2 by adding layers, using `+` between the different components of the plot to iteratively develop a visualization.\n\nWe can translate the grammar of graphics into generalized ggplot2 code as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = <DATA>) + \n  geom_*(\n     mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>),\n     stat = <STAT>, \n     position = <POSITION>\n  ) +\n  scale_*(<SCALES>, <GUIDES>) + \n  labs(<LABELS>) + \n  coord_*() + \n  facet_*() + \n  theme()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that you do not need to specify all of these elements for your plots. ggplot2 will choose reasonable defaults for those elements you do not specify. Let's now see what this looks like with an actual plot of the `penguins` data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = penguins) +\n  geom_bar(\n    mapping = aes(x = island, fill = species),\n    stat = \"count\", # default stat for geom_bar(). Calculates y.\n    position = \"dodge\" # position bars next to each other\n  ) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")) + # fill scale\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 120, by = 20)) + # More guides for y axis\n  coord_cartesian() + # default coordinates\n  labs(title = \"The Palmer Archipelago penguins\",\n       x = \"Islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica\",\n       y = NULL, # Remove label for y axis\n       fill = \"Penguin species\") + \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13, # Change base theme and font\n                base_family = \"Times New Roman\") + \n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # Remove minor grid lines\n        legend.position = \"top\", # change position of legend\n        legend.direction = \"horizontal\") # and legend direction\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ggplot2_files/figure-html/grammar-of-graphics-1.png){width=2800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## ggplot2 reference guides\nHere are a couple of quick reference guides for working with ggplot2.\n\n- The documentation for [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is really good and should be one of the first places you look for help.\n    - The [Introduction to ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html) is particularly valuable for going over the grammar of graphics.\n- There is also a [Data visualization with ggplot2 – Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html) that provides a nice overview of commonly used aspects of ggplot2. You can view it as either a web page or a PDF.\n- The [ggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet](https://isabella-b.com/blog/ggplot2-theme-elements-reference/) by Isabella Benabaye is a wonderful for when you want to remember how to change a theme element.\n\n## More in depth resources on ggplot2 and visualization\nFor more in depth discussions for how to use ggplot2 and data visualization in general, start with these resources:\n\n- Hadley Wickham et al., *R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data*, Second edition (O’Reilly, 2023), <https://r4ds.hadley.nz>.\n    - [Chapter 1. Data visualization](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize.html): Goes through a similar scatterplot as the [Getting started with visualization worksheet](../worksheets/03-worksheet.qmd) but also contains information about other kinds of plots such as bar plots.\n    - [Chapter 9. Layers](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/layers.html): Provides a more in depth discussion of the grammar of graphics.\n    - [Chapter 10. Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/EDA.html): This chapter is less about the mechanics of visualization with ggplot2 and more about why data visualization is important to understanding data.\n    - [Chapter 11. Communication](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/communication.html): This chapter focuses on how you can polish plots to make them better communicate the point you want to make with them.\n- Kieran Healy, [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction*](https://socviz.co) (Princeton University Press, 2018).\n- Claus Wilke, [*Fundamentals of Data Visualization*](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) (O'Reilly, 2019).\n- Andreas, Krause, Rennie Nicola, and Tarran Brian. \"Best Practices for Data Visualisation\".

The second edition from 2016 is available through the Library. The unpublished third edition is available online at <https://ggplot2-book.org>.\n\n## For inspiration\nIf you want some inspiration for using ggplot2 to make some truly unique visualizations, check out the data visualization work of [Nicola Rennie](https://nrennie.rbind.io).\n\n- She has recently finished a book that goe through 12 different plots she has made, showing how and why she made them: Nicola Rennie, *The Art of Data Visualization with Ggplot2: The TidyTuesday Cookbook* (CRC Press, 2025), <https://nrennie.rbind.io/art-of-viz/>.\n- You can also look over the different [data challenges](https://nrennie.rbind.io/projects/data-visualisation/data-viz-challenges/) she has participated in.\n\n## Visualization and historical argument\n\n- John Theibault, \"Visualizations and Historical Arguments,\" in *Writing History in the Digital Age*, ed.
