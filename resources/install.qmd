## Installing R
Let's start by download R, the programming language.

1. Go to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network) website: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
2. Click on the link in the first box of text that corresponds to your operating system.
3. Download the latest version of R (currently 4.5.2 as of January 2026).
    - For **macOS**, select the `.pkg` file that corresponds to your processor, likely Apple silicon but possibly Intel if you have an older computer.
    - For **Windows**, select the links from the first line, either `base` or `install R for the first time`. They go to the same place. Then select the `Download R for Windows` link with the latest version of R.
4. Double click on the downloaded file (check your `Downloads` folder). Click Yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.
5. If you use **macOS**, it is a good idea to [download and install XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/). You do not need to do this on Windows.

## Download RStudio
Next, let's download RStudio, the application in which we will run R.

1. Go to the RStudio page on Posit's website: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
2. Follow step 2: Install RStudio since you have already complete step 1: Install R. Choose your operating system.
3. Select the `Download RStudio for Desktop` button.
4. Install by double clicking on the downloaded file and accept any prompts.
5. Run RStudio to make sure that everything succeeded.

When you open RStudio, it should look something like this:

Next, check out the [Setting up RStudio](rstudio-setup.qmd) for more information on getting the application and your R environment set up for success.

## Other options
If you are unable to download R and RStudio for any reason, you can use a cloud version of RStudio through [Posit cloud](https://posit.cloud). You can get started with the [free plan](https://posit.cloud/plans/free). All you need is to create an account.
