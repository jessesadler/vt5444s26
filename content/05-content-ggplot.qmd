## Assignment
- Download R and RStudio
    - See [Resources: Installing R and RStudio](../resources/install.qmd) for details.
- Commonplace book writing: Reflect on the use of visualization in the humanities.

## Activities
- Visit from [Bipasha Banerjee](https://bipasha-banerjee.github.io), AI Research Scientist at University Libraries.
- Worksheet: Getting started with visualization 
- Intro to RStudio
- Visualization with `ggplot2` in RStudio

## Resources
See Resources pages for [Installing R and RStudio](../resources/install.qmd) RStudio and visualization.

### Working in RStudio
- [Wickham et al., *R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz), chapters 2, 6, and 8.
- [RStudio User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/)

### Visualization
Make sure to look at the [ggplot2 website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). It is full of great documentation and examples, including a [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf).

- [The Royal Statistical Society Data visualization Guide](https://royal-statistical-society.github.io/datavisguide/)
- [Wickham et al., *R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz), chapters 1, 9, 10, and 11.
- If you want some inspiration, look at [Nicola Rennie's](https://nrennie.rbind.io) visualization projects.
