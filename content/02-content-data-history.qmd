## Assignments
- Look through the [Digital Humanities Research Guide](https://guides.lib.vt.edu/dh) to help situate yourself in the field of Digital Humanities and the resources available to you at Virginia Tech.
- Find a Digital Humanities project that interests you or is in your field. How do you find DH projects? That is a good question to think about. Two good starting places are [Reviews in Digital Humanities](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org) and [DH Now](https://digitalhumanitiesnow.org/). Use these, web searches, and other resources in the DH Research Guide to find one or more projects of interest.
